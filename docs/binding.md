Multiple bindings and SSL support
=================================

Suave supports binding the application to multiple TCP/IP addresses and ports
combinations. It also supports HTTPS via the interface `ITlsProvider`, but the current
recommendation for deploying HTTPS is by letting a reverse proxy manage the HTTPS
termination.


    let cfg =
      { defaultConfig with
          bindings =
            [ HttpBinding.create HTTP IPAddress.Loopback 80us
              HttpBinding.createSimple HTTP "10.0.1.34" 9000 ]
          listenTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds 3000. }
    choose [
      path "/hello" >=> OK "Hello World"
      NOT_FOUND "Found no handlers"
    ]
