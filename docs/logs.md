Getting Hold of Suave's Logs
============================

Current documentation for configuring Suave is either
[in this sample](https://github.com/fable-compiler/fable-suave-scaffold/blob/master/src/Server/Server.fs#L24-L28)
or [in the Logary readme](https://github.com/logary/logary#using-logary-in-a-library).

The below details how to configure Suave v1.x with Logary v3.x:

When you are using suave you will probably want to funnel all logs from the
output to your own log sink. We provide the interface `Logger` to do that; just
set the propery `logger` in the configuration to an instance of your thread-safe
logger. An example:


    type MyHackLogger(minLevel) =
      interface Logger with
        member x.Log level fLine =
          if level >= minLevel then
            // don't do this for real ;)
            System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox.Show((fLine ()).message)

You can use Logary for integrated logging:

    [lang=bash]
    Install-Package Logary.Adapters.Suave

Use the `SuaveAdapter` type to set the Logger in Suave's configuration:


    open Suave.Logging

    use logary =
      withLogary' "logibit.web" (
        withTargets [
          Console.create Console.empty "console"
          Debugger.create Debugger.empty "debugger"
        ] >>
        withMetrics (Duration.FromMilliseconds 5000L) [
          WinPerfCounters.create (WinPerfCounters.Common.cpuTimeConf) "wperf"
    (Duration.FromMilliseconds 300L)
          ] >>
          withRules [
            Rule.createForTarget "console"
            Rule.createForTarget "debugger"
          ]
        )

    let webConfig =
      { defaultConfig with
          logger   = SuaveAdapter(logary.GetLogger "suave")
      }
